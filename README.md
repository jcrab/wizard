# Contact Wizard
Create an application consisting of the following pages:

* Prompt the user for their first name. This is the "homepage" (name it index.php).  Provide a submit button that sends the name to the server for processing.  
* On the next page, display a welcome message that includes the user's name at the top of the next page along with a form for the user's email address.  If they did not provide a name, redirect the browser back to the homepage.
* After the user provides a valid email address, send them to the next page which will ask for their phone number.  A valid email address contains the '@' symbol.  If that symbol is not found, send them back to the email form.
* Finally, after the phone number is provided, display a summary page that includes all of the information gathered along the way: name, email, phone.
* You must use the PHP Session object to preserve data.
